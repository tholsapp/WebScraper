# WebScraper

This project uses requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from New York Social Diary (http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/)
This website provides photographs from the social events that the socialites might attend. Each photo has a caption that
labels those who appear in the photo.

The scraper finds a unique list of the names of the total people who are annotated in the captions of the photos from the
parties before December 1st, 2014.
